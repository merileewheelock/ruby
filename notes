Ruby is a true OOP language (very difficult to go procedural)
- Encapsulation
-- Bundle all data and methods together
-- Also hiding stuff that shouldn't be available
- Abstraction
-- Share what matters, avoid what doesn't
- Inheritence
-- Super/subclass
-- Car --> Electric Car
-- Monster --> Vampire
-- Shape --> Square
- Polymorphism
-- Allows you to use the same code to do different things
-- IN terms of inhertitence, you have a Shape --> Square, Shape --> Circle
-- shape.draw() AS OPPOSED TO drawSquare(), drawCircle()

- Ruby is a general purpose inerpreted language (doesn't compile) like node, php, or python
